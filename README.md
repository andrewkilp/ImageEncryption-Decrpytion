# ImageEncryption-Decrpytion
converts data into a png file and can decrypt them into a txt file (couldn't figure out other extenstions)
Notes:
there are probably alot of optimizations (this is my first actual java project)
  the images / decoded files are put into the defult directory of a project not where the file is
  the files start having alot of extenstions in it after you encrypr and decrypt it like result.txt.png.txt
