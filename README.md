# ImageEncryption-Decrpytion
converts data into a png file and can decrypt them into a txt file (couldn't figure out other extenstions (just change it after))
Notes:
there are probably alot of optimizations (this is my first actual java project)
  the images / decoded files are put into the defult directory of a project not where the file is
  the files start having alot of extenstions in it after you encrypr and decrypt it like result.txt.png.txt


if you need to change it back into an old format change the extenstion to what you want (also can modify the decrypt to have a parameter of what type of file to make into). this will work because it uses the hexadecimal value
